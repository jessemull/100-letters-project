      The <strong>100 Letters Project</strong> is driven by the desire to
      promote real-world human interaction in an increasingly digital landscape
      and create meaningful connections through handwritten communication. Over
      the course of a year, I will write 100 letters to 100 individuals.

      This website will showcase these exchanges, offering a digital display of
      the letters with details about the recipients and the reasons behind their
      selection.
